## Water Potability Prediction — ML Project


This project demonstrates a real-world machine learning workflow to predict whether water is potable (safe to drink) using physicochemical parameters from a publicly available dataset. It covers data cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization.


# Project Overview

	•	Goal: Build a predictive model to classify water samples as potable (1) or non-potable (0).
	•	Approach: Use Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and imbalanced-learn to simulate a complete data science pipeline.
	•	Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle — includes chemical features and target label “Potability”.


# Dataset Details

Each record corresponds to a water sample with features such as:

## Feature	Description

pH	Acidity / alkalinity level
Hardness	Total dissolved salts (Ca, Mg)
Solids	Dissolved solids in water
Chloramines	Disinfectant concentration
Sulfate	Salt presence from sulphur compounds
Conductivity	Ionic concentration measure
Organic Carbon	Organic content in water
Trihalomethanes	By-product of disinfection
Turbidity	Water clarity
Potability	Target (0 = not potable, 1 = potable)

Dataset size: ~3,200+ samples
– Numerous missing values, outliers, and class imbalance issues included.


## Methodology & Workflow

# 1. Data Loading & Exploration
	•	Uploaded dataset into Colab
	•	Explored head, summary statistics, data types
	•	Visualized missingness with heatmaps

# 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	•	Imputed missing values using median
	•	Standardized features using StandardScaler
	•	Detected and mitigated outliers (visual inspection, z-score etc.)
	•	Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality (6 principal components)

# 3. Handling Class Imbalance
	•	Used SMOTE to oversample the minority class (potable)
	•	Ensured balanced dataset for training

# 4. Model Training & Comparison
	•	Trained six classifiers:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Decision Tree
	•	Random Forest
	•	K-Nearest Neighbors
	•	SVM (with probability output)
	•	XGBoost
	•	Evaluated with accuracy and classification reports

# 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
	•	Employed RandomizedSearchCV for:
	•	Random Forest (n_estimators, max_depth)
	•	XGBoost (n_estimators, learning_rate)
	•	Selected the best estimator for final evaluation

# 6. Final Evaluation
	•	Computed confusion matrix for best model
	•	Calculated ROC-AUC score
	•	Visualized performance using seaborn/matplotlib


## Key Results & Insights
	•	The best performing model (based on held-out test accuracy) was selected.
	•	The model achieved a competitive ROC-AUC, indicating good class separation.
	•	Important features affecting potability include pH, hardness, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity.
	•	PCA + SMOTE were effective in reducing noise and balancing the dataset.
